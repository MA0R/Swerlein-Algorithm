# Swerlein-Algorithm
A python GUI for controlling the Swerlein Algorithm (digital sampling for the HP3458A digital volt meter)
The Thread is stand alone and can be used by simply importing into any other python program. It contains a pythonised version of the algorithm first published in the 1980s in BASIC. The algorithm consists of one main error computation followed by the result measuring. Many constants are due to the inherent innacuracies specific to the HP3458A.
